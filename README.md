# UV Development Environment Setup üöÄ

Streamline your Python data science projects with `uv`. This guide covers setup instructions from installation to dependency management.

## Dependency Files Explained

Before diving in, let's clarify the roles of `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`:

- **`requirements.in`:** Specify your project's direct dependencies and their version ranges here for flexibility and compatibility.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Generated from `requirements.in` by `uv`, this file pins all dependencies to specific versions for a consistent and stable environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python (versions 3.8 to 3.11 supported) is installed on your system.


2. **Install `uv`:** Pick the right `uv` installation method for your OS.
   - **macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```
   - **With pip:**
     ```bash
     pip install uv
     ```
   - **With Homebrew:**
      ```bash
      brew install uv
      ```

3. **Navigate to your project directory:** (for example `yolov8-detection`, `tf2` or a new project directory)

    ```bash
    cd yolov8-detection
    ```

4. **Create and activate a virtual environment:** With `uv venv` a virtual environment is created in the `.venv` directory.

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **(Optional) Increase HTTP Timeout:** To prevent timeouts during package installation (step 6.), especially for larger packages like PyTorch, increase the HTTP timeout:

    ```bash
    export UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=600
    ```


## Using an Existing Model

If you're working with an existing model that includes both `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`, follow these steps:


1. **Install dependencies:** Install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Optional Steps:

- **Upgrade Dependencies:** To update dependencies based on requirements.in, recompile to generate an updated requirements.txt:

    ```bash
    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
    ```

- **Adding a New Package:** If you need to add a new package, insert it into requirements.in with version constraints, then recompile to update requirements.txt:

    ```bash
    echo "flask>=2.0.0, <3.0" >> requirements.in
    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
    ```

## Creating a New Model

When starting a new model, you'll need to create `requirements.in` and generate `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. **Define Dependencies:** Create requirements.in with your model's dependencies. Ensure to specify versions that are tested and compatible with your model.

    - For a range of acceptable versions (e.g., Flask):
        ```bash
        flask>=2.0.0, <3.0
        ```
    - For a fixed version when compatibility is crucial:
        ```bash
        flask==2.0.0
        ```
    - For specifying a minimum version:
        ```bash
        flask>=2.0.0
        ```

2. **Lock Dependencies:** Generate requirements.txt from your requirements.in.

    ```bash
    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Proceed with installing dependencies specified in requirements.txt.

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Configuration üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è

## Customizing the Dockerfile

Below is a template Dockerfile adjusted to use with Picsellia‚Äôs provided images, suitable for a bounding box cropping task:

```Dockerfile
# Select the base image according to your CUDA and Python requirements
FROM picsellia/cpu:ubuntu20.04-python3.10

# Update and install necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Argument to trigger rebuilds
ARG REBUILD_ALL
ARG REBUILD_PICSELLIA

# Copy the requirements file and install dependencies using uv
COPY ./src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper/requirements.txt ./src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper/
RUN uv pip install --python=$(which python3.10) --no-cache -r ./src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper/requirements.txt

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /experiment

# Copy the source code
COPY ./src/decorators ./src/decorators
COPY ./src/models ./src/models
COPY ./src/steps ./src/steps
COPY ./src/*.py ./src

# Copy the pipeline code
COPY ./src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper ./src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper

# Set environment variable for Python path
ENV PYTHONPATH "${PYTHONPATH}:/experiment/src"

# Specify the entry point for running the pipeline
ENTRYPOINT ["run", "python3.10", "src/pipelines/bounding_box_cropper/processing_pipeline.py"]
```

## Usage

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t bounding-box-cropper .
```

To push the image to a container registry, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker push bounding-box-cropper
```


# Tests üß™

## Pytest integration

We utilize the `pytest` framework for all our testing needs.
You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

To run all tests in the repository, you can execute the shell script that wraps our pytest commands:

```bash
bash run_all_pytest_tests.sh
```

## Simulating GitHub Actions locally

To replicate GitHub Actions locally, we leverage `act`, a tool that simulates GitHub Actions on your local machine. This allows you to test workflows before committing changes to the repository.

1 - Install `act`:

First, install act using the following command. This script will download and install the latest version of act:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

2 - Prepare the environment file:

Create a .env file in the root directory of your repository with the necessary environment variables. Replace <votre_token_picsellia> with your actual Picsellia test token:

```bash
PICSELLIA_TEST_TOKEN=<votre_token_picsellia>
PICSELLIA_TEST_HOST=https://staging.picsellia.com/
```
Important: Do not include CODECOV_TOKEN in the .env file unless you intend to upload coverage results to Codecov during local testing.

3 - List available jobs:

Before running the actions, you may want to see a list of all available jobs defined in your GitHub Actions workflows:

```bash
act -l
```

4 - Run a specific job:

To execute a specific job, such as common-model-tests from the common_model_tests.yaml workflow, use the following command:

```bash
act -j common-model-tests
```
